# Starbucks Capstone Project

This is the final capstone project for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program.

The project contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. 
The goal of the project is to analyze this "historical" data in order to develop an algorithm that finds
the most suiting offer type for each customer.

The data is contained in three files:

- portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
- profile.json - demographic data for each customer
- transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed
